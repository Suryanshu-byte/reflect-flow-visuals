Project Reflect 
This project is an innovative approach to calendar management that transcends the limitations of traditional calendars, which typically focus solely on listing events and dates. Instead, it features a dynamic interface that utilizes visual representations, such as mood graphs, to track and illustrate your emotional state throughout the day, month, or even the entire year. 

By analyzing your mood patterns, this project intelligently organizes and prioritizes your calendar, seamlessly integrating various aspects of your life. It efficiently manages meetings, to-do lists, upcoming events, holidays, and more, allowing for a more holistic overview of your schedule. This dynamic arrangement not only helps streamline your tasks but also encourages a deeper understanding of how your emotional well-being is influenced by your commitments. With this forward-thinking calendar solution, you can foster improved time management and emotional awareness, enriching both your personal and professional life.
